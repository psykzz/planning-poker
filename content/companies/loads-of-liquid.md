## Who we are.
Founded by a group of friends gaming together over 10 years, we are a PvP focused group who have played numerous MMOs, Strategy, Survival and FPS games.


What we expect from you.
We are looking for solid PvP heads that will listen to direction and follow tactics we lay out. However, we are not looking for drones and you need to have spacial awareness and be able to react to the situation around you instead of going into tunnel vision.


We like people to be active on discord and be ready for some banter, that part is important to building up a camaraderie. 


We like to share guides and information with the intention of perfecting our builds, gear and skills in the game. You don't have to be a hardcore Min/Maxer, but it helps. 


You don't have to devote your life to the game but if you expect to be out of it for more than two weeks we would appreciate it if you let us know.


## What we are looking for.
We aren't looking for farmers or crafters, we will do a bit between us here and there and try organize the pooling of resources towards certain goals but this is a PvP Company and we are ideally looking for capable PvPers.


We are looking for PvP focused player with a positive mindset willing to work in a team and towards the companies goals. We don't have many rules but above everything we expect you to be excellent to each other.


Right now we are looking for all roles but specifically seeking quality frontliners. Unkillable Sword and Shield wielders and tough, agile Axe and Warhammer players who can dive on the back line and survive long enough to get out if they are in trouble. We are also looking for highly mobile Muskets to be part of an elite sniper squad.
